# PepsiCo Sales Star Micro-Internship – Analytics Project

## Retail Market Execution Study – Yavatmal, Maharashtra

- This repository documents the work completed during my PepsiCo Sales Star Micro-Internship, where I conducted an on-ground retail market study across 25 stores in Yavatmal, Maharashtra.
- The goal was to assess PepsiCo’s in-store execution, analyze competitor presence, and identify opportunities to expand rack placement.

## Objective

To understand real-world retail execution by evaluating:
- PepsiCo’s current rack availability
- Competitor racks and key competing brands
- Potential space for installing new PepsiCo racks in stores with no presence

## Scope of Work

Over a period of 10 days, I visited 25 diverse retail stores, covering:
- General stores
- Supermarkets
- Kirana shops
- Small convenience outlets
I collected firsthand insights through direct store observation, owner conversation, and visual assessment.

## Key Activities

- Documented PepsiCo rack visibility, product arrangement, and shelf presence.
- Mapped competitor brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, local beverage brands) and their display quality.
- Identified available floor/shelf space for new PepsiCo racks.
- Evaluated store layout conditions affecting brand visibility.
- Logged findings and categorized stores based on readiness for rack installation.

## Methodology

- On-ground field visits
- Visual audits & manual data logging
- Store owner interviews
- Comparative display analysis

## Insights & Findings

- Several stores lacked PepsiCo branded racks, even when competitor racks were present.
- In many outlets, adequate space existed but had not been utilized for PepsiCo racks.
- Competitor brands often had better eye-level placement and visibility.
- Store owners showed willingness to allocate space if given better display solutions.

## Outcome
This study provided actionable insights on:

- Where PepsiCo can improve retail execution
- Which stores are strong candidates for new rack installation
- How competition is positioning their products
- Challenges faced at the last-mile retail level
- These findings support better execution planning and market expansion strategies for PepsiCo in small-city retail environments.
